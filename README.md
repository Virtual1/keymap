Keycodes @ JayJo
======

Keycodes is a small application used to grab keyboard and character codes quickly and easily. No one enjoys sifting through lists of text trying to find the one keycode they need.

Give [Keycodes](http://keycodes.atjayjo.com) a shot!

Keycodes is an ongoing project. Have a look at the roadmap for additional info.

Feel free to fork Keycodes and contribute or leave any comments on how I can improve Keycodes.

Follow me [@jayjo](http://twitter.com/jayjo) on Twitter for updates.

Thanks for stopping by.
